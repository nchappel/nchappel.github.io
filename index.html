    The University of Vermont (UVM), officially the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, is a public research university and, since 1862, the state of Vermont's sole land-grant university. The University of Vermont is one of the original Public Ivies, a publicly funded university considered as providing a quality of education comparable to those of the Ivy League. Founded in 1791, UVM is among the oldest universities in the United States and the fifth institution of higher education established in New England after Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, and Brown.
